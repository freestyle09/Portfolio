      '"Your recipes" is an application created for people who have their own cooking recipes written on some paper sheets. Inspiration for this application was my wife, she always lost her paper sheets with cooking recipes! Now she can forgot about them and save her cooking recipes on her account. First you need to think what and how much components and steps you will need to prepare a meal. You can also add a timer to turn on alarm when your step is done. Alarm will be ringing until you will not close it. After this you can follow your own written cooking recipe step by step without any mistakes. Noone like to eat a burnt chicken, right?',
